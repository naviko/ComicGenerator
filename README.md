# Sassy Comic Generator #
Really stupid little comic generator used by SassyBot of Discord and GameJolt fame.
Meant to be used in conjunction with something else, but you can use it yourself from the command line.
Generates completely incoherent comic strips that sometimes make sense but mostly don't.

The two included panel packs were drawn by Nik Sudan and JuiceFox, so a big thanks to them.

I don't care what you do with it but this thing comes with no warranty so don't blame me if it brings down your company servers.
THIS SOFTWARE IS PRESENTED AS-IS WITH NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OH MY GOD WHY IS THIS IN ALL CAPS.
